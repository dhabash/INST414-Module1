# INST414-Module1
I’ve been a tennis fan since I was eight years old. Some of my best childhood memories involve playing tennis with my dad, competing in tournaments, and most of all, watching the Grand Slams. When you watch tennis, there’s always a little box in the corner showing the score, the players' names, and their rankings. Before I watched enough tennis to choose my favorite players, I would automatically root for the lower-ranked player. I’m not sure if it’s how I was raised, but even today, I always root for the underdogs, even if it’s against a player I like.
Recently, I watched the US Open with a friend who loves to bet on sports. He placed a bet on Jannik Sinner (ranked 1) to win over Taylor Fritz (ranked 12). Naturally, I was disappointed with the outcome of the match, but my friend made a good amount of money betting on Sinner. This got me thinking. How much does rank actually matter in tennis? Should you bet on the underdog, or is it better to just cheer for them off the court? Beyond sports betting, this kind of information could be invaluable to marketing companies. They need to know whether their ad campaigns starring tennis pros will pay off or not. We recently saw this when Grey Goose teamed up with fan favorite Francis Tiafoe, only for him to tragically lose in the semi-finals
